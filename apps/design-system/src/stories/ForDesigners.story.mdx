## Software
### Sketch
We use [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) for all high fidelity mockups and then publish to [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) to gather feedback, or to make available for developer use.

Shared [Sketch libraries](https://www.sketch.com/docs/designing/libraries/) are stored in OneDrive and are used to keep components consistent over multiple projects.  

**Tip:** Turn off the Sketch auto-save feature to reduce CPU overload on your Mac.

### Sketch plugins
#### Anima
We use the [Anima plugin for Sketch](https://support.animaapp.com/en/articles/2594242-get-anima-plugin-for-sketch-adobe-xd-or-figma) to help stack and align elements within components.

#### Zeplin
[Zeplin Mac app](https://support.zeplin.io/en/articles/244927-installing-the-sketch-plugin) for Sketch

### Other useful plugins
[Symbol Instance Locator](https://github.com/sonburn/symbol-instance-locator)  
[Symbol Instance Renamer](https://github.com/sonburn/symbol-instance-renamer)

## Typography
**IBM Plex** is the corporate typeface for Berlitz. It is an open source project developed by the IBM Brand which means it can be **downloaded and used for free** by anyone.  

The result is a neutral, yet friendly typeface that balances clarity and distinction, and that will mirror the clear, progressive tone of Berlitzâ€™s brand tone of voice.  

The family includes a **Sans** and **Mono** typeface and has excellent legibility in print, web and mobile interfaces. Sans typeface is preferred to Mono.

If you cannot find an appropriate icon, you can create a custom icon as long as you follow in the style of Streamline.
