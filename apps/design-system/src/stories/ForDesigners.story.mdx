    The Groom Squad Design System is a curated collection of UI components, foundational styles, and design standards that help us craft elegant, modern, and accessible user experiences.   
    
    This page explains how to work with our design principles, shared Figma libraries, and plugins to keep your work aligned across products.

    ### Learn The Groom Squad’s Design Guidelines
    These shared foundations and reusable UI elements create a unified experience across all of our platforms.
    - [Foundations](/docs/foundations--docs) define visual rules like color, spacing, typography, and iconography.
    - [Components](/docs/elements--docs) are flexible, reusable interface elements. Each comes with usage guidelines, accessibility tips, and interaction behavior.
    - [Patterns](/docs/patterns--docs) are combinations of components and foundations used for standard UI flows (internal-only).
    - [Content](/docs/content--docs) includes tone and voice guidance for microcopy, button labels, alerts, and more.

    ### Use Figma to Apply the Design System
    Our Figma libraries and tools include foundational styles, design tokens, components, and workflow helpers.
    - The Groom Squad [Figma libraries](https://www.figma.com/design/647cIYTo2RD5qUZMB9GpBc/The-Groom-Squad?node-id=280-1794&t=Py6RLsVAc4lkrd9Z-1) include:

    Lucide React is our standard icon library—open source, scalable, and built for modern interfaces.
